Ronin Final Project
-------------

For our final two-week project on Ronin, we wanted to create a web application that allowed users to search through recipes to find one's requiring specific ingredients. The idea behind this was that many people end up throwing out food because they don't know how to use it within a recipe. This web application would allow people to find exactly what ingredients could be used for.

Given more time, we would like to implement ways to search by preparation time or dietary requirements. An important feature we would add would be the option to upload a photo when added a recipe to the database. We would also like to make it possible to share recipes on social media sites.

JavaScript/Angular - Testing

Make sure the rails server is running for testing angular as they interact within the end to end tests(e2e).
